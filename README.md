# Unraveling Brainstem Deformations in Joubert Syndrome: A Statistical Shape Analysis of MRI-Derived Structures


Code repository in construction for the provisionally accepted MICCAI 2025 paper: Unraveling Brainstem Deformation in Joubert Syndrome: A Statistical Shape Analysis of MRI-Derived Structures


🧑‍💻️ **Installation**


📝 **Dataset**

Under folder 'Dataset', data used in the project are available and divided in three subfolders.
- 'original': contains the raw .obj shapes of brainstem at original resolution as obtained by segmentation masks from MRI;
- 'remeshed': contains preprocessed .obj shapes at 3K resolution after cleaning and remeshing procedure via rematching [];
- 'bm': contains .mat files scaling back from low to high resolution shapes
