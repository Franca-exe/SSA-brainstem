# Unraveling Brainstem Deformations in Joubert Syndrome: A Statistical Shape Analysis of MRI-Derived Structures


Code repository under construction for the provisionally accepted MICCAI 2025 paper: *Unraveling Brainstem Deformation in Joubert Syndrome: A Statistical Shape Analysis of MRI-Derived Structures*


🧑‍💻️ **Installation and Requirements**


📝 **Dataset**

Under folder 'Dataset', data used in the project are available and divided in three subfolders.
- '*original*': contains the raw .obj shapes of brainstem at original resolution as obtained by segmentation masks from MRI;
- '*remeshed*': contains preprocessed .obj shapes at 3K resolution after cleaning and remeshing procedure via [ReMatching](https://github.com/filthynobleman/rematching)
- '*bm*': contains .mat files scaling back from low to high resolution shapes

For privacy reasons, all data are anonymized and provided with basic information in 'info_subjects.xlsx'.
After approval, data will also be available in Zenodo and [BOARD](https://board.unimib.it/research-data/)
